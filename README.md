# r-Hololive-Data-Collection
Connect to Reddit's API to collect data on new submissions to the Hololive subreddit and write it into a Google Sheet.


Before running the script, you need to get a Reddit client ID and client secret which you can get once you have created an app on the website (https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). This script also writes the data into a Google spreadsheet, so you will also need to create a project on Google and get the authorization to access your Google drive and spreadsheet (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
